scanner is a class in java.util package used for obtaining the input of the primitive type like int,char, and strings.
it is the easiest way to read input in the java program though not very efficient
To create an object of a java class we usually pass the the predefined object system in which represents the standard input string.
we may pass of an obect of a class file if we want to read input of a file

1. void  	 close() 		it is used to close the scanner
2.pattern 	delimeter() 		it is used to get the pattern whcih the scanner class is currently using to match delimeter
3.stream 	<matchResult> 		findall() it is used to find a stream of match result that match the provided pattern string
4.string	findline()		it is used to find the next occurence of a pattern constructed from the specified string,ignoring delimeter
5.string	findwithin Horizon()	it is used to find the next occurence of a pattern constructed form the specified string ignoring delimeter
6.boolean 	hasNext()		it returns trud if this scanner has another token in its input
7.boolean	hasNextBigDecimal()	it is used to check if the next token in this scannner input can be inteerpretted as a bing decimal using
                                        the next bigDecimal()method or not
8.boolean	hasNextBigInteger()	it is used to check if the next token in this scannner input can be inteerpretted as a bing decimal using
                                        the next bigDecimal()method or not

9.boolean	hasNextBoolean()	boolean '' Nextbig Boolean()
10.boolean	hasNextByte()		it is used to check if the next token in this scanner input can be interpretted as a byte using the next bigDeimal()method
11.boolean	hasNextfloat()		float next float as a
12.boolean	hasNextdoublee()	it is used to check if the bigdecimal Nextbyte() method
13.boolean	hasNexTINT()		int nextint()
14.boolean	hasNextLine()		it is used to check if there is another line in the input of this scanner of not
15.boolean	hasNextLong()		long  next longer
16.boolean	hasNextshort()		short next short()
17.IO Exception	io Exception()		it isused to get the IO Exception last thrown by this scanners readable
18.locale	locale()		it is used to get a locale of the scanner class
19.MatchResult	match()			it is used to get the match result of the last scanning operation performed by tis scanner
20.string	next()			it is used to get the next complete token from the scanner which is in true	
21.BigDecimal	nextBigDecimal()	it scnans the next token of the input as a big decimal
22.Biginteger	nextBigInteger()	it scans the next token of the input a Biginteger
23..boolean	nextBoolean()		it scans the next token of the input into a boolean vaue and return that value
24.byte		nextByte()		IT scans the next token of ine input as a byte.
25.double	nextDouble()		it scans the next token of the input as a double 	
26.int 		nextInt()		It scans the next token of the input as integer
27.float	nextFloat()		it scans the next token of the input as float
28.String 	nextLine()		it is used to get the input string that was skipped of the scanner object
29.long		nextLong()		it scans the the next token of the input as along
30.short	nextShort()		it scans the next of the input as short
31.int		radix()			it is used get the  default radix of the scanner use
32.void		remove()		it is used when remove  operation  is not supported by this implementation theorem
33.scanner	reset()			it is use to reset the scanner which is in use	
34.Scanner	skip()			it ships input that mathches the  pattern "ignoring"delimeter
35.Stream<string> tokens()		it is used to get a stream of dlemeter-seperted token fom the scanner objext which is in use
36.string	toString()		it is used to ge ther string representation of scanner using
37.Scanner	useDelimeter()		it is use to set the delimilin pattern of the scanner which is in use to the specified pattern
38.Scanner	useLocale()		it isused ot sets this scanners locale object to the speified locale
39.Scanner	useRadix()		It is used to set the default radix of the scanner which is in use to the specified radix
